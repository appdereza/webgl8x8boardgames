About
-----

This is a web application for playing some 8x8 board games, against your computer or with a local/remote friend.
It only works in browsers with WebGL support, and implements the following games:
- Draughts (with the rules I used to play at school, that were similar to portuguese draughts)
- American checkers
- Chess / Chess960
