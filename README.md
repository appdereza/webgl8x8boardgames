About
-----

This is a web application for playing some 8x8 board games, against your computer or with a local/remote friend.
It only works in browsers with WebGL support, and implements the following games:
- Draughts (with the rules I used to play at school, that were similar to portuguese draughts)
- American checkers
- Chess / Chess960


Click [HERE](http://wgs-jmarine.rhcloud.com/webgl8x8boardgames/) to play the games.


Installation
------------

The application files should be deployed into a web server to work properly in some web browsers (although Firefox also works fine loading the game from local files).

This application also requires a [WGS server](https://github.com/jmarine/wgs) to support multi-player online games. To install a private WGS server, follow these [instructions](https://github.com/jmarine/wgs/wiki/Installation). After installation, you need to access WGS's administration page, and create 4 applications with the names: chess, chess960, checkers and draughts
(the other settings don't need to be changed).
